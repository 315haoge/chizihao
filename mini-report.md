## Experience to maintain repo
The task is very time consuming if the one who try to submit PR doean't follow some convention. Tools such as GitKraken can greatly help to maintain many branches that can't be seen at GitHub.
## Experience to review PRs
In my case, I try to make sure that my PR is not conflicting with any other collaborators. If you have a conflict in your PR, the maintainer usually don't have enough time or patience to take a look at your PR.
## Lessons learnt
Tools and Convention can help collaborator and maintainer to achieve better Quality of Life. Using Edit Tools in GitHub usually can introducce an unseen problem.
