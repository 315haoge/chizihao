## Experience to maintain repo
It is hard to manage repository for me because there are many pull requests and sometimes it occurs confliction.
Therefore there are not good pull requests like the negative sentence while I want to get positive sentence.
## Experience to review PRs
I feel review is important because some pull requests are not good for me.
If I had merged everything, it would have been messed up.
## Lessons learnt
It is difficult to manage the repository which can send pull request from many people.
I want to check some issue and whether there are same pull requests already.
I think it is more complex in OSS repository case.
I wonder why they can managed OSS repositories.

## Experience to maintain repo
It is quite interesting to keep merging while managing the conflict. Most of the time I have to fix the conflict in merging by myself (some people edit the same part of the abstract). 

## Experience to review PRs
Many people keep making pull request with a negative sentiment although my goal is to get the positive sentiment in abstract. From this, I know that the direction of the project should be clearly define in the repo.

## Lessons learnt
Although this class is just the mock-up, I feel that it is quite difficult to find people to make the pull request for my project. I think when I make my own real project I should keep to contribution.MD simple and easy to read so it can attract more people to contribute in.
