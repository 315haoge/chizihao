## Experience to maintain repo
Maintaining a repository is a good thing so that the developer's repository are further modified and developed. But it quite messy when the changes have to be checked and there are also many developers involved.
## Experience to review PRs
I found that if I had a late check for pull requests it would cause other people who came to fix it at the same point to reconfigure and I need to fix the conflicts. Exercises for the class is small enough to be easily modified, but if it's a large-scale, it might take a lot of time.
## Lessons learnt
Learn how to fork to help edit or update other developers' work. Made me realize that maintain a repository is important in social interaction.
