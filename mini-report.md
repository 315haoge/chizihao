## Experience to maintain repo
It is quite interesting to keep merging while managing the conflict. Most of the time I have to fix the conflict in merging by myself (some people edit the same part of the abstract). 

## Experience to review PRs
Many people keep making pull request with a negative sentiment although my goal is to get the positive sentiment in abstract. From this, I know that the direction of the project should be clearly define in the repo.

## Lessons learnt
Although this class is just the mock-up, I feel that it is quite difficult to find people to make the pull request for my project. I think when I make my own real project I should keep to contribution.MD simple and easy to read so it can attract more people to contribute in.
