## Experience to maintain repo: 
It is hard to maintain the repository with a lot of people and a lot of contributors. A lot of contributors come with a lot of pull requests that means the repository's owner needs to check a lot of changes file and might have to discuss with these contributors before merge to the main branch.
## Experience to review PRs: 
From the example in the class, each pull request doesn't change much so I don't feel much hard for reviewing the pull request. On the other hand for the big repositories, there will be a lot of changes in each pull request that why many repositories have rules for pull requests.

## Lessons learnt: 
This is my first time doing the pull request so It was opened my world about how and steps to become a contributor. And the class let me practice so that It makes me more clearly and also discuss the pro or con of managing/maintaining systems (as that pull request need to be reviewed first and also the doing steps on Github)
